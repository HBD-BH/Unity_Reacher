# Project 2: Continuous Control

Solution to the second project of Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree.

### Introduction 

Trying to move a double-jointed arm to a target location. 

### Setting

Reward +0.1 for each time step where the agent's hand is in the goal position.  
Observation space size: 33  
Continuous action space size: 4, each entry being $\in$ [-1,1]  

In the first version, a single actor is to be trained. The environment is solved with an average reward of +30 over 100 consecutive periods.
